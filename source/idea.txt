## Ideas
 
- MAYBE NOT HARDWARE
- 
- Symptom -> diaganosis program
- Something that measures wellness based on breathing patterns
- Covid 19 tracker app
- clothing item that measures pressure and tension put upon an area after surgery to make sure that the wounds arent gonna rip or get hurt.
    - can be a uniform design (open cylinder) to allow for use anywhere on the body
    - uses a matrix of points within the garment to determine tension on that part of the body
    - same matrix of points also are pressure sensors to make sure the area is not being compressed
    - if either measurement exceeds a level set by doctor after surgery, alerts the user with a beeping noise (could be anything really)
    - can connect to some application that would display the tension/compression and allow the user to set the limits for both (this would be given by a doctor after the operation)
    - should we use shear force too?
        - another mechanical force that we are not accounting for
        - could be pretty hard to measure/implement, but it might be doable
    - compression
        - measured by each point on the garment. would obviously be in psi. essentially a bunch of mini scales
    - tension
        - could be done in one of two ways: distance between the points in the garment (more complicated, would have to rely on wireless signals) or some kind of string between each point that would directly measure the tension (easier programming wise but would be harder to physically implement)
    - name? idk, working title can be "Safety Sleeve". we can finalize that later
    
we will need to do a write up, a video showcasing our solution to our problem, and all of the actual source

i am thinking that we could make two things for this. one cpp program to actually get the inputs, analyze the data, and then give outputs ans
and then one application to allow for the displaying of the data and the setting of the safety limits
